# Pokedex
This project was done at a code-along. I just couldn't resist.

The learning objectives of this exercise were:
1. DOM Manipulation
2. Fetching data from the API
3. Adding an even listeners

This fetches data from the PokéAPI. Type in a Pokémon name or number to get information on that Pokémon.
